## Enrollment data

Enrollment data are stored in `./shared-enrollment` folder on the host machine.
This folder contains keytabs and certificates that are created when the machines
are enrolled into domains.

## Required resources

Required resources depend on your configuration but to run all guests together
with one of the example configuration you can expect the following requirements:

* Approximately `9 GiB` of available operating memory
* Approximately `50 GiB` of disk space

However AD boxes can operate with a lower amout of operating memory (1 GiB) so
the memory requirements can be reduced to approximately 7 GiB.
